        "Article": "It’s Monday morning, and Julia Fox is doing her skincare routine while vaping and wearing a floor-length fur coat. We’re in an industrial warehouse in Brooklyn, N.Y., for her FASHION cover shoot. She arrives alone (a rarity in the world of celebs) and apologizes for keeping us waiting. “I woke up late and had to rush to take my son to school,” she shares. (Fox also apparently missed the memo about the pre-arranged car service and drove herself to set — another anomaly.) “I haven’t done anything — not even brushed my teeth!”\nPlopping her tiny Y2K-inspired shoulder bag onto the table, she begins to unpack big containers of moisturizer in a Mary Poppins-esque montage. Not bothering to roll up her furry sleeves, she slathers on two products: Lait-Crème Concentré by Embryolisse and Homeopasmine (a Vaseline-like product usually used for nipple chafing). Together, the creams cost about $60. “I’m not really into those 13-step beauty routines,” Fox admits. “I mean, who has time for all that?” Certainly not her.\nDepending on who you talk to, Fox’s fame can be linked to any number of things. Many would surely know her as Adam Sandler’s girlfriend in 2019’s Uncut Gems. Those who missed the movie would probably recognize her as Ye’s (formerly known as Kanye West) 30-day dalliance and dress-up doll. But for most fans under 40, Fox is more than her filmography or flings; she’s a viral icon, a charismatic sound bite and a fashion alchemist whose extreme outfits have included everything from condoms to literal flames.\nSoon to be added to her ever-growing resumé is judge and co-host (alongside legendary stylist Law Roach) of the upcycling competition show OMG Fashun, which is premiering on May 6 on E! She teases that it’s a “campier” Project Runway — new artists will be brought in every episode to turn trash into treasures. “I want to advocate for sustainability,” Fox says of why she got involved in this project. “I want to show people that fast fashion is ruining the world. And I think anyone with a brain would want a one-of-a-kind piece rather than some mass-produced sh*t that every Becky in the world has.”\nTrue to her reputation, Fox does not mince her words. Every sentence ends with a firm period and is spoken with such conviction that you can’t not accept it as the truth. On the topic of self-love: “Nobody truly loves themselves.” On her three-year-old son, Valentino: “He’s my anchor, which is awesome but can also suck.” On fashion: “I don’t want to wear something pretty — pretty is boring.” You get the idea. And while many have speculated about whether her bluntness is a branding shtick or true authenticity, I’m not sure it matters. (Though, for the record, I do think Julia is just being Julia.) During a time when everyone’s images are so curated and words are so calculated, Fox dares to be messy and sometimes a little trashy — and the internet loves her for it.\nIf you’ve read Down the Drain, her 2023 bestselling autobiography, you know that Fox’s life reads like a crossover episode of Euphoria and The Sopranos — only with more heroin. Her tumultuous childhood started in Milan (she was born to an Italian mother and an American father) but very quickly had her bouncing between odd spots in New York. Think sleeping on a boat one week, squatting in buildings her father was renovating the next and in friends’ houses, a boyfriend’s drug den, a sugar-daddy-owned loft and a number of other dicey living situations.\nAt 16, her absentee parents put out a “missing” poster for her, which covered the city, but they reported her birth year, height and weight wrong. Shortly after, she overdosed on PCP after a stint in a psychiatric ward. And in her final year of high school, she became a dominatrix after seeing a Craigslist ad. Mix in multiple abusive relationships, being banned from Bloomingdale’s for stealing and buying 200 cockroaches to unleash at her ex-boyfriend’s nightclub and you get a true picture of a rebel with far too many causes. “It was like I became an investigative journalist for my own life,” Fox says of writing her memoir. (Most of her memories from her younger years are quite foggy.) “It was a weird form of therapy. For the first time, I really just had to sit with my past and dissect it.”\nConsidering her many highs and even more lows, I ask Fox if she has any regrets. Taking a drag of her vape — like she’s a character in a Scorsese movie — she replies: “Yeah, I have a few. But ultimately I wouldn’t change anything. I have to trust that there’s something bigger at play and one day it will all make sense.”\nFox has famously said that she always knew she was going to be famous. She explains that everywhere she went, she somehow became a household name, with friends regularly telling her she was going to be a star. And while she admits to liking attention, she never wanted this much attention. Though, ironically, she points out that no one admits to wanting to be famous because “it’s tacky.”\nSCULPTURE PHOTOGRAPHY BY DANIEL KUKLA, COURTESY OF FRIEDMAN BENDA AND MISHA KAHN.\nBut then she digresses: “I always saw the pitfalls of fame. I grew up in the Britney Spears era, and I understood that anonymity is a gift. I didn’t want fame, but now that I have it, I wouldn’t not want to have it.” Fox stops herself and backtracks a little — the only time during our hour-long chat that she seems uncertain about her words. “I don’t know — it really just depends on how I’m feeling. Some days, I f*cking hate it and I’m like, ‘Why did I get myself into this?’ And other days, I’m so grateful to be in this position where I can have this platform. It all really depends.” \nFox would love to one day fade into the background and let her work speak for itself, but she doesn’t think she’ll have that luxury until she’s older. Of course, grocery shopping in only her underwear might not be helping. Or the fact that she calls the paparazzi on herself — something every celeb does but will never acknowledge. “I don’t call them when I’m in my regular clothes, which some people do to keep their name in the headlines,” she says with a twinkle in her eye. “I do it when my look is amazing — if I have a designer I’m obsessed with and I want them to have their moment.” \nAs such, Fox isn’t interested in following the “unwritten celebrity code” of wearing luxury brands. Instead, she’s inspired by new talent doing new and unconventional things. “I’m looking for a designer who thinks outside the box, goes against the grain or does something I’ve never seen before,” she says. She adds that she’s only interested in wearing wearable art. And to say her taste is specific would be a bit of an understatement. On-set, Fox knows what she wants to try on — and even more what she doesn’t. She diligently examines every look FASHION stylist Ashley Galang has pulled and has a strong opinion about all of them, pushing most of the bigger labels to the side in favour of smaller, independent ones.\nIt appears that for Fox, fashion is a way of regaining control of her image and reclaiming the narrative she once lost. In one interview sound bite turned viral TikTok audio, she shares that she doesn’t dress for the male gaze anymore but for “the girls and the gays.” And based on the aggressive online reaction her looks elicit from straight men, who can blame her? “I hope that women know that men are our biggest threats,” Fox declares very nonchalantly. “They think they own our beauty and can decide who’s pretty and who’s not. But what the f*ck do they do for us? After I had my son, I realized I don’t need a man anymore. I did it — I had a kid. Now I can go be me and dress for me because I don’t need a man to ‘like me’ anymore.”\nFox’s indifference to men on the whole is one of the things her fans love the most about her. When she took a lie detector test for Vanity Fair, she hilariously got caught lying about not hating men, which she took in stride. Similarly, on Ziwe, she revelled in the host’s purposefully shocking questions and gave even more shocking answers, particularly when she was asked if she’s pro women killing men: “If the men deserve it, then yeah. Men kill women all the time for no reason.” Still, Fox rejects the title “radical feminist” and reinforces that she’s just “stating facts.” After weeks of defending herself as being the real author of her book and not resorting to using a ghostwriter, she’s more certain than ever that society underestimates women. “The game is rigged,” she says. “Even when you win, men will say it’s luck. But I think that’s why women kill it all the time — there’s no room for failure.” \nThat said, Fox recognizes that men are also victims of the patriarchy — just victims that benefit. “Having a little boy and seeing how sweet and gentle he is makes me really worried about what the world is going to do to him and that he’s going to come out an asshole,” she says. So, one thing she’s really concentrating on is creating a safe environment for him at home to cocoon him from the influence of toxic masculinity. “He loves my clothes. He loves my makeup. He loves my music, friends and partying — he’s a little mini me.” And it’s because of Valentino that sustainability has become such a priority for her — hence OMG Fashun. \nAlso on the horizon? Presence, a Steven Soderbergh thriller with Lucy Liu. And Fox is in the midst of casting a movie that she wrote—“I got my dream star to be in it!”— and developing Down the Drain into a miniseries, which includes the difficult task of casting herself. She’s open to finding someone more unknown for the role. “I think I want to go to all the public schools in New York and hold auditions there,” she says. \nIn the meantime, Fox has finished her skincare, loosened her fur coat and stopped vaping. As I walk with her to the hair and makeup chair for her photo-shoot prep, we chat casually about ghosts and psychics. Fox goes as far as to ask me to send her the contact of my roommate’s 80-year-old clairvoyant. (Apparently she’s looking for a new one.) But that’s just Julia Fox for you. She’s gritty and grounded yet ethereal and sometimes otherworldly — traits she hopes to continue exploring through writing fiction books and more scripts. “Ultimately, I just want to create worlds that I — and other people — can get lost in,” she says. Count us in."

        "Article": "Bad hair days? We don't know her. Make some shelf space for the Supersonic Nural.\n\nBy\nSouzan Michael Galway\n\nDate May 2, 2024\nIs there anything more fun than being let in on a secret? As I toured Dyson’s massive Research, Design and Development (RDD) campus in Malmesbury, England earlier this year, I was struck (and a little overwhelmed) by the amount of security and confidentiality everywhere. I was scanned in through one door that allowed me to walk exactly ten steps before needing to be scanned in through the next door, and so on and so forth. Had I entered the future? Nearly everything on campus was labelled “CONFIDENTIAL” — including garbage bins. (Seriously!)\nSo what’s the big secret? Well, it’s not a secret anymore. Dyson just launched its latest hair tool, the Supersonic Nural (plus the super-sleek Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer, though the latter is exclusively for professional stylists). The available-to-consumers Supersonic Nural is an updated version of Dyson’s first foray into hair back in 2016, the Supersonic. You read that right: an even more advanced version of what was already the most technologically advanced hair dryer on the market.\nThe updates include new sensor technology that protects scalp health by automatically reducing heat as it gets closer to your head. It also has a motion-sensing feature that deactivates the heater and decreases airflow when you’re in between styling passes (like when you set the dryer down to section your hair). This allows Supersonic Nural to cut way back on its energy use.\n \n \nA post shared by Dyson Beauty (@dysonbeauty)\n\n“We started working on Nural back in 2021, five years after Supersonic launched,” says Steve Williamson, Hair Care Category Manager, Commercial Engineering RDD Haircare. “Our mission when developing, from an engineering point of view, is ‘all hair types, all hairstyles, less damage’.” Talk about ticking all the boxes. “We always start with [addressing] a problem,” adds Dyson Beauty’s Global President, Kathleen Pierce. “We’re constantly on a journey to understand how our tech can improve experiences.”\nA major part of that journey involves watching how people use the products, both through in-lab testing prior to launch, and on social media post-launch. #Dyson currently has 7.7 billion views on TikTok, most of which are videos of users posting GRWM or how-to videos using their Dyson hair tools. “I think I’ve watched every single video. There’s just no shortage of people we can learn from,” says Pierce.\nHow to diffuse curls/waves step by step! But tbh Dyson’s NEW Supersonic Nural does most of the work for you 🤭 Here are some key features: – Helps protect the scalp – Pause detect mode when you place the hairdryer down! – Remembers your attachment preferences Literally obsessed with the new diffuser attachment, I mean the results speak for itself 🥹 #curlyhair #curlyhair #curlyhairroutine #wavyhair #haircare #gifted\n ♬ Walking up with You – Omar Enfedaque \n \nNot long ago, a friend of Pierce’s sent her a video where she was using one of Dyson’s hair tools. “My friend’s hand was coming up higher [than we’d expected],” says Pierce. “So I immediately showed the video to our engineers, and they were like, ‘Interesting; if she’s holding it there, maybe the tension is different. Maybe we move the silicon strip. And then the next thing I know, they’re ideating solutions for the problem. That’s what’s so brilliant about working with passionate engineers. I think if we’d set out to target consumers, or we’d set out to [follow] a trend, we’d probably end up being behind the curve. When you set out to solve a problem, you’re going to unlock things you would never have anticipated.”\nShop The Supersonic Nural Now\nThis article contains affiliate links, so we may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links on our site at no additional cost to you.\nA version of this article appears in FASHION’s Summer 2024 issue.

        "Article": "This trio just can't stay away from one another. \n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\nDate May 1, 2024\nWarning: Minor spoilers for Challengers ahead.\nChallengers, the new film from director Luca Guadagnino, is a tennis movie in every sense of the word. Except that, it’s really not. Despite the fact that the film centres around the sport, highlighting the grunts, backhands and — most importantly — the sweat, as Tashi Duncan (Zendaya), Patrick Zweig (Josh O’Connor) and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) battle it out on the court, the sport is really only an avenue through which the three characters express their love for one another.\nAnother way? Through the clothes each one chooses to wear — and, ultimately, share. The film uses shared clothing, mainly between Zendaya and the two men, as a visual way to convey their interconnectedness to one another, even when they’re not all physically together. (Plus, sharing clothes with a lover is categorically hot.)\nIt should come as no surprise that fashion plays an important role in Challengers. With Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson designing the costumes for the movie (and fashion girlie Zendaya on board), exactly what each character wore was always going to be integral to the story. And it is, with Anderson using brands to convey important messaging about where each character is throughout the timeline of their lives.\nAs adults, Tashi dons luxe cashmere and Chanel, a nod to her need for, and obtainment of, power. And Art — the calm, buttoned-up ice to Patrick’s fire — is always in stark, crisp Uniqlo whites. He’s inoffensive, and some may say a blank slate for Tashi to project her dreams onto, both on and off the court. While these identifiable brands are important to the individual characters, it’s actually two outwardly normal T-shirts — and their place in two pivotal scenes — that speak to the heart of the film and the complicated dynamic between the trio. Essentially, they can’t exist without one another.\nWe see this early on in the film. While attending Stanford University together, Art and Tashi sit down for a post-tennis practice lunch in the dining hall. Innocuous at first, their convo quickly turns from tennis to love, or lack thereof, with Art informing Tashi that his longtime BFF and her current boyfriend Patrick isn’t in love with her. Tashi tells him off as only Zendaya can; shutting Art down with a succinct and curt AF: “What makes you think I want someone to be in love with me?” Oof. It’s an intense scene in an already fraught film, a verbal sparring match between lovesick Art and guarded Tashi about, ultimately, their feelings for each other. He wants Tashi and Tashi doesn’t want him, or arguably anyone else.\nWhile Art is effectively trying to push Patrick out of the picture, the pro tennis player is still physically represented in the scene. Throughout their conversation, Tashi dons a now-iconic grey T-shirt emblazoned with “I Told Ya” on it. Whether or not the shirt (available on Loewe) is originally Patrick’s or Tashi’s is up for debate, but as viewers see in later scenes, it becomes synonymous with the former, who picks it up off of Tashi’s dorm room floor amidst their fight and ultimate breakup. Patrick, despite being away on tour, is still an ever-present entity in Art and Tashi’s dynamic.\nIt’s telling then, that years later in Atlanta, the trio would bump into each other while Patrick is wearing the “I Told Ya” t-shirt; the literal and figurative embodiment of Tashi and Art’s problems and desires combining into one.\n \n \nA post shared by Jonathan Anderson (@jonathan.anderson)\n\nMore than a decade after first meeting and now in 2019, we see this dynamic reversed when, the night before the big Challengers final match, a 31-year-old Tashi meets up with Patrick to ask him to throw the game in order to boost Art’s confidence. Having come straight from an intimate power struggle with her now-husband Art, Tashi has thrown an oversized plain white men’s T-shirt over her lace nightgown, similar to (or perhaps one of?) the basic tees that Art wears off the court.\nRegardless of whether or not it is actually one of her husband’s T-shirts, like Patrick’s “I Told Ya” shirt, it has become synonymous with the tennis player throughout the film, bringing even more depth and meaning to her impassioned conversation and eventual hook-up with Patrick.\nNot only does the sharing of clothing, and Tashi donning the pieces in pivotal moments, signal her own internal division — always thinking about one man while in conversation or a relationship with the other — but the interconnectedness of the three. Even in these intimate moments one-on-one with Tashi, both Patrick and Art are never fully out of frame, brought into the scene — and the love triangle — via a piece of clothing.\nIn these heightened, sometimes erotic moments, even when they’re not all physically together, the trio are still inextricably linked. And that’s the way it has to be for them to function and be truly happy, both on and off the tennis court. It’s a realization the characters themselves have in the final moments of the film when Art and Patrick finally embrace; the realization that they work best when they’re together.\nIt may be new info to Tashi et al, but this reality — like Patrick and Art’s love for each other — was there all along, all in the form of a T-shirt.\n\nBy\nNatalie Michie\n\n\nDate May 3, 2024\n\n\nBy\nSarah Mariotti\n\n\nDate May 3, 2024\n\n\nBy\nSarah Mariotti\n\n\nDate May 2, 2024\n\n of \n\n© 2024 SJC Media\n"

        "Article": "Compassion doesn't come easy in Apple TV+'s 'Palm Royale' — or in the real world. Kaia Gerber has thoughts about that. \n\nBy\nNatalie Michie\n\nDate May 1, 2024\nKaia Gerber wishes we said “sorry” a little more often. “People apologizing when they bump into you? That feels like it should go without saying, but it doesn’t — at all.” The model-turned-actor is calling from her home in Los Angeles, and the conversation has turned to common decencies.\n“Sometimes just acknowledging that you’re wrong can be pretty powerful,” I offer. But Gerber isn’t even asking for that much. “Yeah, or just that I exist, maybe.” For her, simple goodwill gestures go a long way.\nExpectations of etiquette and thorny pricks of impoliteness are the underlying premise of Palm Royale, Apple TV+’s new dramedy that stars Kaia Gerber alongside legends like Kristen Wiig, Laura Dern and Carol Burnett. Satirizing the social-climbing scene of 1960s South Florida, the sun-drenched romp is all things soapy, silly and shamelessly melodramatic. And it marks the latest addition to Gerber’s acting resume, as the high fashion muse shifts her focus from walking runways to collecting cast credits.\nBrimming with busy bubblegum prints and codes of conspicuous consumption, Palm Royale is a whacky ride examining anxieties of the status-seeking elite. Gerber’s character Mitzi — a sweet but naive ingenue — exists on the periphery of this privileged bubble. She’s introduced as an aspiring model with a belittling boyfriend, working a slew of day jobs from manicurist to cocktail waitress. Despite her charming sincerity, Mitzi’s biggest flaw is failing to see her own value. Kaia Gerber empathizes with that.\n“Every person has insecurities, and especially as a woman — and a woman whose job it is to be looked at in that way — it can do a lot to your self-esteem,” she says. “I started modelling quite young, so I relate to the lack of experience, and maybe a lack of self-awareness, in certain ways.”\nGrowing up with Cindy Crawford as a mom, Gerber’s professional foray into the fashion industry was practically a given. (She made her modelling debut at 10 years old.) When I ask if she connects to Mitzi being underestimated, she shoots back dryly, as if we both already know the answer. “No, I don’t relate to that at all,” Gerber says, adding a giggle to confirm that she is, obviously, kidding. Of course she knows the feeling.\nAs the daughter of a world-renowned supermodel, the 22-year-old is no stranger to quick judgments. Born into stardom by association, she has, in recent years, become a fixture of the viral nepo baby discourse. But unlike many celebs with A-list parents, Gerber doesn’t deny the unfair advantages of having a famous family. Still, with a private life propped under pop culture’s microscope, it’s no surprise that she’s a fan of not assuming the worst in others.\n“I remember every time that I’ve needed kindness and someone has given it to me,” she tells me. “I know how important that can be; how powerful that can be. And I would never want to miss the opportunity to do that for somebody else.” This sort of sensitivity translates to her onscreen counterpart. In a show predicated on conditional allies and malicious gossip, well-meaning Mitzi is a reprieve.\nThe role is comparable to Gerber’s previous gig in Emma Seligman’s 2023 lesbian comedy Bottoms. In the cult-favourite film, she plays Brittany, a cheerleader who’s positioned as vapid but whose quips sharpen as the story progresses.\n \n \nA post shared by Kaia (@kaiagerber)\n\nBoth Mitzi and Brittany are beautiful (obviously), endearingly ditzy upon first impressions and misjudged at the core. Also, they’re both really funny. The latter can be chalked up to Gerber’s take on these supporting roles, as she flips the script on the airhead archetype by getting in on the joke. It’s clear she’s not just taking random roles to bloat her portfolio; she’s choosing projects — and characters — she believes in.\nDelivering customer service with a smile to the unbearable upper crust, Mitzi’s rose-coloured glasses keep her from getting jaded, which Gerber admires. “As easy as it is to become pessimistic today, life is so much more enjoyable when you believe the good in people,” she says. At the same time, Mitzi is perhaps too trusting, getting entangled in a life-altering affair with murky power imbalances. “I think that Mitzi sees the good in people to a fault,” the actor reflects. “And maybe she’s not fully protecting herself.” It begs the question: Is unguarded kindness worth it if you risk being met with manipulation? Gerber seems to think so.\n“It says a lot more about the people who take advantage of you than it does about you,” she muses, adding that it’s possible to practice self-preservation while still being pleasant. At this point, we’re not really talking about Mitzi anymore. “One of the things I learned through watching the incredible actresses I got to work with is you can have boundaries and still be nice,” says Kaia Gerber, who filmed Palm Royale with Wiig, Dern and Burnett. “As a woman in this industry, you never want to be called ‘difficult,’ but I’ve learned that sometimes when they’re calling you ‘difficult,’ it’s really that you have boundaries and that you care.”\nCaring is not always popular, but it tends to make you want to understand people more, even if just through small-scale niceties. This is probably why, when asked which courtesy Gerber wishes was more common, she lands on the informal apology.\nJust like her Palm Royale character, Kaia Gerber knows what it’s like to be seen as weak, she says. But why should she harden? “What I love about Mitzi and the way that her character develops is that you do see her start to find herself; find her strength and learn and grow.”\nGerber is working on that too, surprising audiences with her skillful on-screen subtleties, crafting her comedic timing and continuing to carve out a name for herself in her own way. In the meantime, though, your kindness would be much appreciated.\n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\n\nDate April 4, 2024\n\n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\n\nDate March 22, 2024\n\n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\n\nDate March 20, 2024\n\n of \n\n© 2024 SJC Media\n"

        "Article": "It's almost the first Monday in May! \n\nBy\nStephanie Davoli\n\nDate May 1, 2024\nThis article was originally published on November 9, 2023 and has been updated. \nIf the first Monday of May is basically your Super Bowl, we have some very exciting news for you. The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute announced the theme of the Met Gala 2024: “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.”\nNaturally, social media immediately began speculating about what exactly this seemingly vague theme could represent — and if attendees will actually stick to the theme. Contrary to some people’s interpretations of the title, the 2024 gala isn’t about the classic Disney fairytale or Beyoncé’s “Cozy” Renaissance Tour costume.\nSo what does the “Sleeping Beauties” theme mean? Here are all the details on the Met Gala 2024 so far.\nAs always, the Met Gala will be a celebration of the Costume Institute’s spring exhibition, which acts as the foundation for the fashion event’s dress code.\nAccording to Vogue, approximately 250 pieces spanning over a 400-year history — including at least 15 archival items deemed too fragile ever to be worn again — will be on display during the exhibit’s run in New York City from May 10 to September 2, 2024. These exceptionally rare garments are the “sleeping beauties” of the Costume Institute’s collection.\nthe 2024 met gala theme has just been officially announced — ‘sleeping beauties: reawakening fashion’ with the right execution this could be a very successful one!! pic.twitter.com/2nJAPV2EYJ\n— ❦ (@saintdoII) November 8, 2023\n\nWith a focus on sustainability, the exhibit will be categorized into three zones: land, sea, and sky. Each of these will include garments comprised of materials that can be traced back to their respective category, with the aim of highlighting the relationship between fashion and the environment.\nOne example of the kinds of designs that the exhibit will showcase is the iconic 2011 Alexander McQueen butterfly dress which was part of former creative director Sarah Burton’s first collection for the fashion house. The hourglass dress is fully embellished with meticulously crafted artificial butterflies and is said to represent the promise of “transformative renewal.” It’s an exceptional piece that has rarely been worn beyond the runway, aside from when Elizabeth Banks donned it for her portrayal of the fashion-forward Effie Trinket in The Hunger Games. \n \n \nA post shared by Vogue France (@voguefrance)\n\nThe collection will also consist of original pieces from designers such as Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Hubert de Givenchy — whose work will surely act as inspiration for the looks we’re bound to see at the annual gala.\nOn the importance of this year’s exhibit, Andrew Bolton, head curator of The Costume Institute, said, “Fashion is one of the most emotional artistic forms because of its connection to the body. It is imbued with memory and emotions, and we relate to it very much via our senses. One thing I hope this show will activate is that sensorial appreciation of fashion.”\nThe 2024 Met Gala will fall on Monday, May 6. As usual, it will be held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC, with its star-studded red carpet taking place on the museum’s iconic front steps.\nThe exclusive event’s guest list is never revealed before the gala, but we expect to see many familiar celebrity faces on next year’s red carpet. Several members of the Kardashian family typically attend the big night and fan favourites like Rihanna, Zendaya and Blake Lively often grace the museum’s steps as well.\nRihanna is The Queen of the Met Gala. Period. pic.twitter.com/OQJJtOcsXk\n— Emmanuel Fourès (@MrFoures) March 10, 2019\n\nIn the months leading up to the big night, more information about who’s attending will likely be revealed.\nOn February 15, Vogue announced that Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez and Zendaya would form the official host committee along with Anna Wintour. Meanwhile, honorary chairs for the event are Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. As Vogue notes, the co-chairs are a mix of longtime Met Gala guests (like J.Lo, who has attended a whopping 13 times) and first-timers (like Hemsworth, who has never been to the fashion event), along with Bad Bunny and Zendaya who have walked the Met Gala steps three and five times respectively.\nThe 2023 Met Gala was held in honour of late designer Karl Lagerfeld with the theme “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.” Despite Lagerfeld’s controversial legacy, looks from the evening’s gala celebrated his decades of work at iconic fashion houses including Chanel, Fendi and Chloé.\nStandouts from last year’s event included Dua Lipa, co-chair of the 2023 gala, who wore an elegant vintage Chanel tweed ballgown famously first worn by Claudia Schiffer on the runway in 1992. In addition to the variety of throwback Chanel and Chloé looks that graced the gala’s carpet, some stars opted for a more literal interpretation of Lagerfeld’s legacy. This included Doja Cat’s fully feline-inspired ensemble, which was meant to represent Lagerfeld’s beloved pet, Choupette.\n \n \nA post shared by Check the Tag (@checkthetag)\n\nThe theme of the 2022 Met Gala was “In America: An Anthology of Fashion,” which provided lots of “gilded glamour,” star-studded opulence.\nFashion fans will surely remember Kim Kardashian borrowing Marilyn Monroe’s famous “Happy Birthday Mr. President” dress for the evening and Blake Lively, who wore a transformative Statue of Liberty-inspired gown.\nBetween the years of history the annual gala holds and the exciting nature of this year’s theme, we’re sure that the 2023 Met Gala will be another big night for the fashion industry — and we’ll be keeping up with all the details until the first Monday in May 2024.\n\nBy\nNatalie Michie\n\n\nDate May 3, 2024\n\n\nBy\nSarah Mariotti\n\n\nDate May 2, 2024\n\n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\n\nDate April 30, 2024\n\n of \n\n© 2024 SJC Media\n"

        "Article": "Thanks to trailblazing tools like Dove’s Code My Crown, change is here.\n\nBy\nKayla Greaves\n\nDate April 30, 2024\nThis is Texture Talk, our long-running column that deep dives into the dynamic world of curly hair, from crowns of curls that are free flowing to strands that are tucked away in a protective style.\nThe world of video games thrives on — and even necessitates — forward-thinking innovation and reinvention. Yet while the second wave of the natural-hair movement (which started in the 2000s and ramped up tremendously in the 2010s) fuelled a cultural shift and continues to showcase the importance of proper and equal representation of Black hair, the gaming industry has lagged behind.\n“There has been little to no evolution of Black-hair representation in the gaming industry,” says Isaac Olander, CEO of Tallgran Studios and a lead contributor to Dove’s Code My Crown, a free guide that launched last year to help video-game designers create precise digital depictions of natural hair. “Although there are millions of Black gamers [contributing to the over $300 billion industry], textured hair and protective styles are still extremely limited and stereotypical,” says Olander. Users often have to choose from caricature-like, racist options — such as matted cornrows and messy locs — when building their characters. “This can leave Black players feeling unseen and unwelcome in the gaming space.”\nWhile some may argue that digital representation in a fictional space is irrelevant, the vast majority of Black video-game users disagree. One study found that eight in 10 gamers have felt “excluded, discriminated against or not good enough” due to poor portrayals of textured hair. For celebrity hairstylist Lacy Redway, whose clients include Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj and Teyana Taylor, this hits particularly close to home. “I’m a Black mom raising a Black child who is a gamer,” says Redway. “I’ve watched him create characters on a game platform, and I realize how difficult it still is to achieve accurate Black features.”\nThat’s why when Redway was presented with an opportunity to partner with EA Games to help develop modernized textured styles for The Sims 4 Growing Together Expansion Pack, it was a no-brainer. One of Redway’s key areas of focus included developing accurate depictions of bouncy coils, laid baby hairs, braided buns and single plaits — all of which were successfully translated into the game.\nBut the process wasn’t without its own set of obstacles. “The way a character moves can change how the hairstyle looks,” says Redway. “That’s why free-flowing curls and fly-aways are the most challenging styles to create.” While Maxis — the graphics team behind The Sims — was able to work with the hair expert to remedy these issues, small-scale or independent design teams may lack the means to make textured strands authentically come to life on digital screens. “There are limited resources when it comes to coding natural or textured hair,” says Olander. “This is due to not only a lack of knowledge in how natural hair moves and the cultural nuances of the styles themselves but also a lack of understanding when it comes to how to use digital tools to create more realistic hairstyles.”\n“This is just the beginning of a transformed gaming industry.”\nThis is where Code My Crown comes in. Developed with a team of Black game developers and celebrity hairstylist Nai’Vasha Grace, the guide provides step-by-step coding instructions for accurately creating a variety of textured styles while simultaneously educating users about the historical context and cultural impact of the different styles. “When it comes to conversations about Black hair and how to depict our texture, most of that comes from lived experience,” says Redway. “Having conversations about Black culture requires the involvement of Black people.”\nBut with gaming’s exclusionary history of textured styling and only 2 per cent of developers identifying as Black, one question remains: Will the space be receptive to these types of strides? According to both Olander and Redway, the answer is yes. “Game developers have wholeheartedly embraced the initiative,” says Olander. “This is just the beginning of a transformed gaming industry — one that considers all of its players, not just select groups.”\nThis article first appeared in FASHION’s April 2024 issue.

        "Article": "The actress has attended the coveted fashion event many times since 2009. We're taking stock of all her Met Gala looks ever — the good, the questionable and the Y2K. \n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\nDate April 30, 2024\nAnne Hathaway is thriving. With a buzzy — and steamy — new movie set to be released in early May, and a certified style renaissance behind her (this leopord look!), it only makes sense that the former Princess of Genovia would grace us with her presence at the 2024 Met Gala.\nWhile Hathaway’s attendance at this year’s Met Gala hasn’t been confirmed (attendees tend to start teasing their looks — and photos of their coveted invites — in the days leading up to the big night), there’s no denying that this year’s theme was made for her. “The Garden of Time,” a dress code celebrating the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute’s newest exhibition”Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” is inspired by English novelist J.G. Ballard’s 1962 short story of the same title. An interpretive text about the passage of time and life, Vogue expects there to be a a ton of florals and botanical looks gracing the infamous Met steps (you know, like life in bloom?).\nThis means that Anne Hathaway will be in her element. Who better to represent and speak to the beauty and uncertainty of life than Hathaway herself, a former child actress who has faced public scrutiny only to see her career blossom and flourish in her 40s? The answer is literally no one. Plus, the actress knows how to turn out an A+ look.\nOver the past several years, Hathaway and her longtime stylist Erin Walsh have revamped the star’s wardrobe, taking her from beautiful but more generic looks to high fashion, and embracing the star’s sexy style in mini-dresses and platforms. In other words: Mother has been mothering\nWhich is why we’re so excited to see what the The Idea of You actress dons at this years Met Gala. Hathaway has attended the fashion event on and off since her first appearance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2009 (wearing a very late 2000s bubble dress from Marc Jacobs), but it was her last two appearances, at the 2018 and 2023 fêtes, that really cemented her as burgeoning fashion royalty. Ahead of the 2024 Met gala, we’re taking a look back at all the Anne Hathaway Met Gala looks as her style evolved over the years, including the good, the bad and the straight-up Y2K.\nFor her first appearance at the Met Gala, a young Hathaway channeled the early 2000s in a big way. The star took to the carpet in an eggplant bubble dress from Marc Jacobs (the nostalgia!), accessorizing with strappy metallic platform sandals, Van Cleef & Arpels jewellery and a bouffant that could rival that of a Southern debutant. The only accessory missing? A pink Motorola Razr phone.\nChanneling her character Mia Thermapolis from The Princess Diaries for her second Met ball, Hathaway played it safe — but very pretty — with a champagne Valentino dress, jewels from Bulgari and a Ferragamo bag. Given how style has evolved at the Met Gala itself, with red carpet looks starting out safe and becoming increasingly avant-garde as the event’s cachet grew (and big names like Rihanna and Zendaya started showing up), Hathaway’s look wasn’t out of place.\nSay what you want about Hathaway during this period of time, but after becoming a Hollywood pariah with the 2012 release of Les Miserables, the actress leaned into the fact that people were talking about her by just going for it when it came to fashion. Case in point: Her punk look for the 2013 Met Gala. Hathaway channelled punk legend Debbie Harry with her blonde pixie cut and a sheer Valentino creation with feather accents.\nAnnie, what were you thinking? As far as Met Gala looks go, the actress’s 2014 red Calvin Klein two-piece was a letdown; especially considering the theme. The year’s theme celebrated the work of American-based designer Charles James, who was well-known in the 1940s and ’50s for glamorous ball gowns that embraced women’s bodies and were worn by socialites like Millicent Rogers and Austine Hearst. James’ gowns were iconic, voluptuous and decadent, everything that a monochromatic column skirt and strapless top is… not.\nProbably the most controversial of Hathaway’s Met Gala looks to date happened in 2015. After years of bad press and a confusing era of unjustified hate (seriously, what was up with that?!), Hathaway stepped out onto the carpet in a hooded gold lamé gown from Ralph Lauren. As the actress told Vanity Fair at the time, the idea for the dress was inspired by a statue of the Buddha the actress had seen. “I found a few contemporary Chinese artists that I liked and I sent it over to Ralph Lauren, and this was the one we decided to try to interpret,” Hathaway told the magazine.“So we interpreted a Buddha with a hoodie.”\nWhich was *ahem* a choice. The look was a big swing and for some, an ever bigger miss, with the actress compared to Star Wars’ Princess Leia and a Hershey’s Kiss. Nevertheless, the daring look had fans who saw the fashion moment — and Hathaway wearing the heck out of it — as a big f*ck you to the haters.\n \n \nA post shared by Anne Hathaway (@annehathaway)\n\nAfter a few years away from the event, Hathaway returned to the Met Gala and leaned into that year’s theme in a big — and stunning — way. Hathaway wore a voluminous Valentino Couture ball gown with ruffled sleeves and a triangle cut-out, accessorizing with a gold halo crown that made the actress look like an angel. The big draw of the ball gown was the hue, a vivid red that — six years later — is still all the rage. As far as some Met Gala looks go, it was a rather tame, but accurate, interpretation of the year’s theme, and showed that the star could step-away from her Les Miserable-era column gowns.\n \n \nA post shared by Anne Hathaway (@annehathaway)\n\nArguably her best Met gala look to date, Hathaway’s homage to the late Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld was not only perfect for the theme, but one of the best looks of the night. The new face of Versace wore a body-hugging white tweed number with cutouts; the textile was a fave of Lagerfeld, and used in most of his collections. Hathaway accessorized the show-stopping number with a matching jacket, tweed opera gloves (chic!), silver platform heels and a diamond choker by Bulgari. In a year that delivered plenty of major looks from the actress, this Met Gala ‘fit firmly cemented the Devil Wears Prada actress in her fashun era.\n\nBy\nNatalie Michie\n\n\nDate May 3, 2024\n\n\nBy\nSarah Mariotti\n\n\nDate May 2, 2024\n\n\nBy\nStephanie Davoli\n\n\nDate May 1, 2024\n\n of \n\n© 2024 SJC Media\n"

        "Article": "FYI Hollywood, women over 40 are spicy *and* worthy of screen time. Just look to 'The Idea of You' for proof. \n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\nDate April 30, 2024\nThis article was originally published on March 19, 2024 and has been updated. \nWhen you think coming-of-age movies, chances are your mind flashes to the usual suspects: Lady Bird, Eighth Grade, Juno, Mona Lisa Smile, Dead Poet’s Society and (my personal fave) Someone Great. They’re all highly entertaining films starring talent often at the beginning of their careers, playing characters who are slowly but surely coming into their own over the course of the movie.\nSomething else all these films have in common? The character experiencing this monumental personal growth, whether it’s falling in love with their hometown or figuring out that life after eighth grade does get better, are always young — in their teens or early 20s, to be exact. In many ways it makes sense. These early years are when a lot of people make some of their biggest, and most formative mistakes, with the implicit permission to do so. The idea being that the older you get, of course the wiser you are, and that by the time you’re out of your twenties you’re supposed to have your life entirely figured out.\nYou’re an adult, so you’re done growing, right?\n\nNot quite. As any 30-year-old who’s lived on this planet will tell you, this movie fantasy is far from reality. (Me having my sh*t together? In this economy?! No way). Which is what makes Anne Hathaway’s latest movie, The Idea of You, so refreshing. Adapted from writer Robinne Lee’s 2017 book of the same name and inspired by Harry Styles, the Prime Video movie follows Hathaway’s character Solène, a 40-year-old mom and gallery owner, as she embarks on a romantic relationship with 24-year-old music heartthrob Hayes Campbell (played by the incredibly hunky and bedroom-eyed Nicholas Galitzine).\nIt’s a tale as old as time: Girl meets boy at Coachella (where she happens to be with her 16-year-old daughter), girl and boy fall in love, girl doubts herself and her ability to love, girl messes up her chance at happiness, girl realizes she has a lot to offer and can make decisions for her own life, and eventually….well, you know the rest. The only difference is that, in this scenario, girl just happens to be in her 40s. It’s hot, it’s steamy (I mean look at the material they’re working with?!), and it’s realistic (aside from the whole popstar romance, of course), but it’s also something we rarely see on-screen.\n \n \nA post shared by Nicholas Galitzine (@nicholasgalitzine)\n\nThat said, women over the age of 30 haven’t been entirely overlooked recently. The past several years we’ve witnessed a rise of romcoms, adventures and coming-of-age stories for women *of a certain age,* with films like Book Club, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande and Hello, My Name Is Doris featuring actresses like 78-year-old Diane Keaton, 64-year-old Emma Thompson and 77-year-old Sally Field as characters who find themselves later in life.\nThe 2023 awards season also saw a slew of women over the age of 60, including Jennifer Coolidge, Michelle Yeoh, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jamie Lee Curtis and Angela Bassett, take home awards for their work on screen. And while not all of the projects recognized were coming-of-age films and TV shows, per se, at least when it came to awards recognition, there was a visible uptick in stories about older women and their unique experiences, which is 100 per cent worth celebrating. But despite this, there remains a dearth of movies and TV shows about women in the in-between, not quite 30 but not yet getting the seniors discount at the movies.\nWhich is where The Idea of You comes in. This new perspective on the coming-of-age story is what drew Oscar-winner Anne Hathaway to the project. Speaking to media at the SXSW premiere of the film on March 16, the 41-year-old actress said of her decision: “For some reason, we talk about coming-of-age stories as being something that happens to you in the earliest part of your life, and I don’t know about you, but I feel like I keep blooming.” \n \n \nA post shared by Prime Video (@primevideo)\n\nThe idea that we continue to grow and bloom as we age is an important one, allowing people the grace to continue making mistakes, learning and most of all changing. It’s an especially important statement — and story — given the fact that women’s stories are so often either relegated to the background or confined to one dimensional characters, both in the movies and IRL, as they age.\nSolène herself struggles with the idea of seeing herself as a mother and someone who is worthy of a rompy, lustful love. Centering this story as fun, campy and potentially outrageous as it may initially seem is validating, emphasizing that not only do women continue to evolve as they age, existing as more than just one version of themselves, but also that this growth is valid and important to see. Life doesn’t end when you hit 30, 35, 40, 50 or even 85.\nNot to mention, this growth is hot *and* entirely marketable. If film execs are worried about movies about “older” women not being a hot ticket item, Hathaway’s film should quell those fears. The first trailer for the film, released in early March, has already broken records, racking up 125 million views in the days after its release and becoming the most-watched trailer of any original streaming movie. And, the film currently has a 100 per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes.\nEarly reviews of the film (available to stream on Prime Video starting May 2) are raving, and Galitzine and Hathaway’s movie — originally written off as a Harry Styles fanfic — is being heralded as the true return of the romcom genre and “shatters tropes about motherhood and binary choices.” FYI Hollywood, moms — and women — over the age of 40 are hot, and it’s about time they get their recognition.\n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\n\nDate May 1, 2024\n\n\nBy\nNatalie Michie\n\n\nDate April 3, 2024\n\n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\n\nDate March 26, 2024\n\n of \n\n© 2024 SJC Media\n"

        "Article": "Here are my honest reviews, including sizing, support and how much they caused blisters. \n\nBy\nAnnika Lautens\n\nDate April 29, 2024\nRaise your hand if you’ve ever felt personally victimized by your feet. Yup, me too. I have what I call “unhappy feet” — tootsies that are overly sensitive, always complaining and very prone to bleeding and blistering. As a result, I’ve been denied many things: chunky loafers, boat shoes, affordable ballet flats (insert sad violin).\nBut I’ve learned to survive, nay, thrive. I’ve come up with rules like only don one new pair of shoes a week, wear said footwear in short bursts to get your feet used to them and ALWAYS invest in blister socks. But recently, that all went out the window as I tried four pairs of TikTok’s trendiest spring sneakers.\nAll anyone seems to want to know on TikTok (besides why aren’t there more songs about Joe Alwyn on Taylor Swift’s new albums) is what shoes the girlies are wearing this spring. You see, last year, it was all about the Adidas Sambas. Honourable mentions also go to the Nike Dunks and New Balance 990s. But after you’ve worn those into the ground, what happens next? Simple: We need to pick a It shoe of spring/summer 2024 and after extensive research, in the running are the Adidas Gazelles, New Balance 550s, Puma Palermos and Vans Classic Slip-Ons.\nEnter me sacrificing my feet for the sake of fashion. The experiment: Wear and style all four spring shoes for a week. The rules: Go about my day-to-day life and bare my soul (pun intended) in the review process. The results: A few blisters, lots of cute outfits and many *thoughts*. Read on for my honest reviews of some of spring’s best sneakers for women.\nI started the week on rather an unglamorous note: grocery shopping. Wearing the New Balance 550s, I paired them with my go-to errand running outfit: Beyoncé Renaissance cap, white tank from Gap, Aritzia button-up, Lululemon leggings and crew socks.\nAs someone who needs orthotics (I swear I’m not 85 years old!), I was pleasantly surprised by the arch support. The New Balances were super comfy and gave me a literal spring in my step. Bonus: I felt very Hailey Bieber-coded while wearing them and even spotted a teen eyeing my sneakers with approval.\nPros: You can survive a full day of walking in NYC in these and that’s saying something.\nCons: Nothing about the style felt new — a bit been there, done that.\nSizing: True to size.\nSupport: Physical and emotional support provided in spades.\nBlister status: Zero.\nShop Now\nThere are a lot of perks to being a fashion journalist and one of them is getting the occasional free facial. Heading to the spa (which didn’t allow photos, hence this stairwell pic and lack of makeup), I opted for the Adidas Gazelles and went full Americana: COS trench coat, red Amazon bodysuit, Banana Republic cropped white button-up and very worn-in Zara jeans.\nAnd let me just say, I got a lot of attention. Maybe it was the red? Maybe it was because of my extra confidence as I quickly became OBSESSED with these? But I got a lot of looks and people held the door open for me at two other locations. However, these are not long distance shoes. Think more fashion than function.\nPros: The aesthetic! I felt like I was a cool girl in the U.K., which is the dream, isn’t it?\nCons: These sneakers will take a while to break in and there might be some pain in the process.\nSizing: These run a bit big.\nSupport: Very little physical support but my confidence was off the charts.\nBlister status: Imminent. Not full blown bumps but some red, irritated skin made an appearance.\nShop Now\nTruth be told, I changed multiple times before leaving the house in these Puma Palermos. I think this might be my first pair of blue shoes and it took me a second to wrap my head around the ensemble. I ended up going to an evening press preview in a vintage polka-dot dress from Poshmark and a matching blue croissant bag from A Bronze Age.\nHot tip: People love a colourful purse and sneaker combo! From the minute I arrived, I was bombarded by compliments. My takeaway for coloured sneakers is you have to lean into the colour and embrace the pop. As for the Puma Palermos, they were comfier than I thought they’d be and the design is to die for.\nPros: Adorable design and available in a lot of fun colours.\nCons: They are very narrow so beware if you have wider feet.\nSizing: Size up if your feet are on the wider side.\nSupport: Not great but also not terrible.\nBlister Status: By the end of the night my heels were getting a little irritated but it took a few hours to get to that point.\nShop Now\nIf I’m being honest, these Vans Classic Slip-ons were the shoes I was the most nervous to wear and style. The thought of them immediately conjures greasy 14-year-old boys skateboarding in the hallways as I’m struggling to avoid them on my way to class. Inspired by Katherine Singh’s article and Morgan Stewart’s viral Instagram post, I embraced my preppy roots and went super classic with my Aritzia Effortless Pants and a thrifted J.Crew shirt.\nAnd Morgan Stewart was correct — this is an unexpectedly good fit. It’s professional but casual and the checkered pattern goes really well with striped button-up. I even influenced the PR woman I met for lunch to purchase them! That said, these were painful. I walked maybe 40 minutes total and my feet were blister city.\nPros: An unexpected slay that serves serious nostalgia.\nCons: These hurt — a lot!\nSizing: True to size.\nSupport: None.\nBlister status: Invest in bandaids!\nShop Now\nAfter my experimental week I have concluded that colourful sneakers are going to become my new personality. The key is to style these spring shoes from the feet up — don’t be afraid to match your accessories or add another pop of pigment somewhere else in your ensemble. Aesthetically, the Adidas Gazelles and Puma Palermos were my favourite, and the shoes that received the most attention. Nevertheless, I’ll be saving the New Balances for any long walks or travel, and am happy to report that the Vans were the biggest surprise and much more versatile than anticipated.

        "Article": "Here, unconventional denim designs get an eco-conscious redo.\n\nBy\nJillian Vieira\n\nDate April 29, 2024\nWhen it comes to environmental impact, fashion has (deservedly) earned its less-than-sparkling reputation. One of the biggest category culprits? Denim. Between the use of toxic chemical agents and the amount of water required to make it, denim’s carbon footprint is one worth working on.\nIf you’re still into the blue as much as we are, stock your closet with pieces that are designed with conscious intention, including ones made with deadstock materials, organic fabrications, vintage re-works and more. Here, we’ve done the shopping for you — finding the best eco-friendly denim out there.\nIt’s the little things that matter in the goal towards more sustainable denim. That’s why Ganni’s cargo-style jeans — designed with plenty of pockets and a two-tone wash that surprisingly goes with everything — are cut from 100 per cent organic cotton.\nShop Now\nIt doesn’t get more one of a kind than E.L.V. Denim’s street style-worthy pleated cape. Forged from a collection of upcycled denim, each section is colour matched by hand in the brand’s London studio to construct the striking ombré effect. Wear it and watch the compliments roll in.\nShop Now\nThis ballet-flat-meets-chunky-sneaker hybrid is about as innovative in conscious fabrication as it is in out-there design. The soft upper is made from 100 per cent recycled PET (a type of plastic that’s endlessly recyclable) then printed with a denim look.\nShop Now\nIt’s always promising when the upper echelons of fashion take a vested interest in conscious design. The perfect example? This sequin-encrusted denim cap from Miu Miu. It’s part of the iconic brand’s limited edition Upcycled selection, a capsule that transforms vintage garments through circular practices.\nShop Now\nThere’s a timelessness to a denim jumpsuit, especially when it’s fashioned completely out of vintage denim. Since launching its Levi’s off-shoot in 2014, Re/Done has given new life to over 200,000 pairs of discarded jeans, reimagining them for a new generation of denim fanatics.\nShop Now\nThis on-the-nose hit of 2000s-era nostalgia also comes with an eco bent — a crucial piece often missing from the trendiest corners of fashion. Each one of the Nina bags from this Internet-famous accessories brand is made with 100 per cent recycled denim jeans, lending a totally unique outcome.\nShop Now\nEnvironmental impact is at the forefront of Lynn Weare’s thoughtful, elevated basics brand. Her latest seasonless drop includes this angular buckle top, crafted from premium deadstock denim. Another bonus on the eco-minded front: in an effort to prevent overproduction, each piece is made to order in Toronto by a small team.\nShop Now\nThis article first appeared in FASHION’s April 2024 issue.

        "Article": "We're looking back at the most unforgettable Met Gala beauty moments of all time, from Cher's iconic 1985 glam to Lady Gaga's campy gold foil lashes.\n\nBy\nLauren Knowles\n\nDate April 29, 2024\nThis article was originally published in January 2023 and has been updated.\nWith the announcement of this year’s Met Gala theme — “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” — and its corresponding (yet complicated) dress code, “In honour of Karl,” consider the buzz for the 2023 Met Gala fully underway.\nThe curiosity and speculation surrounding the looks to come and how the theme will translate onto the Met red carpet in May leaves us feeling nostalgic each year as we look to the past in search of clues. In my stroll down Met Gala memory lane, I found celebrity beauty looks to be equally as captivating as their fashion choices through the years.\nBe it an 18th century bouffant reimagined in 2004 or nails dripping with “gilded glamour,” there’s nothing I appreciate more than a Met Gala look that’s completely committed to the theme and brief — a.k.a. do whatever is necessary to make the outfit, hair, makeup, and manicure a moment.\nIn anticipation of the 2023 Met Gala, we’ve gathered 10 of our favourite Met Gala beauty moments of all time.\nUndisputedly a Met Gala icon, did you think this list would exist without Cher? In 1985, the >Believe singer looked every bit a glittering beauty with carved out cheekbones and hazy lavender eyeshadow at the “Costumes of Royal India”-themed Met Gala.\nNothing says ’90s quite like chunky blonde highlights, brown-lined lips, and a brightly baked under eye. And who did it better than Naomi Campbell at the 1995 Met Gala? In her peak supermodel era, Campbell complemented her dazzling Versace gown with pure ’90s glam to attend the “Haute Couture”-themed Met ball.\nIn 2004, Amber Valletta gave us a historical how-to on baroque beauty with this bleached pompadour. A modern Marie Antoinette, Valletta was precisely on theme with this “dangerously” heightened hairdo for the “Dangerous Liaisons: Fashion and Furniture in the 18th Century”-themed event.\nWe can always rely on Sarah Jessica Parker for her continual commitment to Met Gala dress codes and dedication to doing anything in the name of a look. It was 2013 and the theme was “Punk: Chaos to Couture” when she paired a complex fishtail bun-meets-braid with a fanned headdress, made by haute couture milliner Phillip Treacy.\nLupita Nyong’o’s 2016 Met Gala look will forever be remembered by this gravity-defying updo (literally). On the “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology” Met Gala red carpet, Nyong’o revealed to André Leon Talley that her towering hair sculpted by hairstylist Vernon François (who also styled her shapely afro at the 2021 Met Gala), was partly inspired by the legendary Nina Simone.\nFor the “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between”-themed event in 2017, Rihanna proved herself a master of the “art of the in-between” and the art of Met Gala beauty. Painted by MUA Lora Arellano, RiRi’s Met makeup was the epitome of a statement look, with fuschia-flushed cheeks that melted into metallic pink eyeshadow accented by a bold berry lip.\nA real renaissance beauty gone rogue, Lily Collins challenged the notion of “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” with her occult-inspired glamour. The look featured a gunmetal smokey eye and Swarovski crystals complete with a single red tear drop. “I’d been thinking about rubies and stigmata and these virginal tears, all the religious iconography that goes with the theme,” said celebrity MUA Fiona Styles, creator of the look, on this symbolic teardrop in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\nAs host of the 2019 Met Gala with the theme “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” Lady Gaga’s entrance was pure camp, complete with four jaw dropping outfit changes. Yet even throughout this theatrical display of couture, we couldn’t take our eyes off of her gold foil lashes and hot pink lip. Crafted by Sarah Tanno, an up-close look at Gaga’s glam reveals black and white graphic liner with under eye jewels, too.\nThough it was only her first appearance at the Met Gala, Euphoria star Barbie Ferreira’s vintage glamour-inspired makeup for the “In America: The Lexicon of Fashion”-themed event will go down as one of our favourite beauty moments in Met history. Thin brows, a pop of purple eyeshadow and pearl accents resting at her middle part punctuated the roaring ’20s makeup look by Kali Kennedy.\nOn a busy Met Gala red carpet, it can be difficult to spot a manicure worth mentioning. But when we do, it’s because it’s truly a work of art. With her golden talons bedecked with silver chain detailing and a wrist chock-full of gold and silver jewels, Cardi B’s manicurist @MarieNailz nailed this look for the “Gilded Glamour” theme.\nFrom Doja Cat’s sharpened claws and prosthetic snout to her dramatic cat eyeliner, the singer’s beauty look honoured Karl Lagerfeld, on whom the 2023 Met Gala theme was based, by paying homage to his beloved blue-eyed Birman cat Choupette.\n\nBy\nSouzan Michael Galway\n\n\nDate March 11, 2024\n\n\nBy\nSouzan Michael Galway\n\n\nDate February 12, 2024\n\n\nBy\nSouzan Michael Galway\n\n\nDate February 5, 2024\n\n of \n\n© 2024 SJC Media\n"

Aveda Be Curly Advanced, a brand new collection of silicone-free vegan haircare products four years in the making, is now available.\nUnveiled in New York City on April 25 to a group of North American press, it was undeniable that Be Curly Advanced was truly a labour of love. “The thing that makes me most excited is that when we were building this product, I really wanted it to be something that brought ease to Black women in particular, because I’m a Black woman myself and I know that wash day is an arduous day,” said Renée Gadar, Aveda global artistic director of texture at the event, emotion evident in her voice. Gadar’s work with Aveda includes teaching, building curriculum and “advocating for true inclusion and diversity in our brand,” as she described in her own words.\n“I wanted to put something out in the field that was for real, for us,” Gadar continued. “I know that the landscape of textured hair is very confusing because there’s so much contradictory information out there and so with this launch also comes an education deck to help artists really understand so that they can [then] give their guests autonomy at home and a feeling of empowerment and ownership.”\nCo-developed by the brand’s global texture team and in-house scientists (“women who also have textured hair,” as Gadar explained in a press release) to bring Aveda’s plant-powered care to the specific needs of curls of all kinds, the formulas were rigorously clinically tested in areas like frizz protection, hydration, strength, shine and definition. The before and after photos are nothing short of mind-blowing and make the impressive product claims, including 72-hour frizz protection in high humidity and 89 per cent improvement in curl definition, feel like no surprise.\nThe collection is comprised of seven products including a co-wash, deep conditioning mask and the innovative Perfecting Primer spray that preps curls for styling by detangling and sealing the cuticle while reducing frizz and protecting coils from getting dried out in the sun.\nShop Now\nFenty Beauty’s latest foundation innovation is here and it’s everything. After teasing its arrival all week long on Instagram, we can finally get our hands on the Soft’Lit Naturally Luminous Hydrating Longwear Foundation!\nInfused with a Natural Luminous Complex made up of oils, polymers and powders, Soft’Lit gives off an effortlessly radiant finish that doesn’t turn shiny or greasy-looking. Like a glowier sister to the original Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation, this new launch is available in 50 spot-on shades that make it easy to find your match from your usual Fenty Beauty foundation. All hail Rihanna.\nShop Now\nTake your hairstyling game to new heights with Oribe’s Hair Alchemy Heatless Styling Balm. The newest member of the brand’s Hair Alchemy family, this lightweight balm adds polish and definition to heatless hairstyles using just a few pumps of product.\nFormulated with Oribe’s very own Curative Blend, it fortifies weakened hair while the yerba mate extract ingredient imparts a fresh-from-the-salon shine. Consider this your sign to ditch your hot tools in favour of air-dried hair (courtesy of the sun) this summer.\nShop Now\nIn the undereye and eyelid areas, visible signs of aging can show up as unwelcome skin thinness, wrinkles, droopy eyelids, eye bags and more. Coming to the rescue, Lancôme’s Rénergie H.C.F Triple serum is the no-needle solution for restoring the skin in and around the eye contour.\nFuelled by a powerful trio of hyaluronic acid,  C + niacinamide and vitamin F ingredients — with decades of extensive research on the skin’s restorative potential conducted by Lancôme to back it up — this triple-threat serum is clinically proven to remedy the aforementioned skin concerns while boosting brightness and radiance around the eye in the process.\nShop Now\nThis article contains affiliate links, so we may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links on our site at no additional cost to you.\n\nBy\nLauren Knowles\n\n\nDate April 19, 2024\n\n\nBy\nLauren Knowles\n\n\nDate April 12, 2024\n\n\nBy\nLauren Knowles\n\n\nDate April 5, 2024\n\n of \n\n© 2024 SJC Media\n"

        "Article": "Scandi girls were first to gain street-style cred, but it’s Scandi boys who should be your next sustainable-style inspo. \n\nBy\nJosh Greenblatt\n\nDate April 25, 2024\nTen years ago, flush with the money I had saved from my first real job, I tentatively wandered into Jonathan + Olivia, a cutting-edge boutique on Toronto’s Ossington strip that, tragically, closed in 2018. It was having one of its legendary sales, and I scoured the racks in search of an affordable designer piece that would, I hoped, accelerate my metamorphosis into a stylish, sophisticated person and stumbled upon a raglan-sleeved crewneck sweatshirt in a grey mélange. It was weightier and cut boxier than the threadbare sweatshirts of my youth — an elevated essential layer I could wear casually or dress up. I checked the tag to see who had made this exceptional garment and discovered a men’s label I had never heard of before: Our Legacy.\nToday, Our Legacy remains at the forefront of Scandinavian menswear, exporting its vision of quirkily layered cool to in-the-know guys around the world, along with the brand Mfpen from Denmark and Another Aspect and Asket from Sweden. These labels project an attitude about dressing that emphasizes individuality and wearability with a sustainable ethos. Some, like Mfpen and Our Legacy, use dead-stock fabrics or digital printing techniques to save water and minimize waste. Others, like Asket and Another Aspect, promote a “buy less, buy better” ethos to encourage acquiring only what you need and nothing else.\nLet’s call the men who embody these sartorial values “Scandi boys.” Unlike Scandi girls, who seem to dress in extremes (super minimalist or Ganni-fied and garish), Scandi boys have a style that resembles elevated norm-core — according to local designers and stylists and a scan of street-style photos from the recent Copenhagen Fashion Week. Think clean shapes, muted tones and at-first-glance unassuming fits amped up with freaky-functional layering and subtle gender blurring. But the devil is in the details: an uncluttered closet that’s heavy on sustainably made everyday staples mixed with second-hand grails. So, what style lessons can we all learn from them?\nIn the early aughts, Scandi brands Acne Studios and Filippa K became the de facto uniform for fashion insiders (and wannabe insiders) because of their raw denim, white sneakers and merino-wool sweaters. The fashion press later labelled the emerging trend “Scandinavian minimalism” — a term that still sticks. It doesn’t so much capture a style as a mentality that informs design, style and consumption. “Scandinavian fashion comes from this element of practicality and comfort,” says Sarah Arts, the head of brand marketing and communications at Asket. “That doesn’t have to mean you neglect style or aesthetic. But I think if you really look at all Scandinavian brands, from interior to fashion, there is that element of clean shapes, practicality and warmth.”\nSome of today’s Scandi boys gravitate toward more classic clothes, according to Nicole Walker, a Swedish stylist who has worked with über-cool brands including Our Legacy. But they’re experimenting with silhouette and gender within the confines of traditional menswear. She also feels there are differences within Scandi style. The Danes, she muses, see themselves as “super ultra-expressive” whereas the Swedes hew toward minimalism. “The menswear scene in Stockholm is really evolving, maybe even more than the womenswear, because of this idea of mixing new and old pieces and really finding personal expression,” says Walker, extolling the resale market for fuelling this sense of discovery and restyling existing clothes in novel ways.\nOne for the men 💅🏻 #whatpeoplearewearing #streetstyle #streetfashion #ootd #mensfashion #springoutfit #scandinavianstyle #stockholmstil #menstyle #scandistyle #outfitspotting #stockholm #swedishstyle \n ♬ original sound – Verona Farrell \n \nAsket represents a modern version of Scandinavian minimalism. Jakob Dworsky and August Bard Bringéus launched the label in 2015 with a T-shirt and have been building a permanent collection of about 50 “zero compromise garments,” or timeless, ethically made wardrobe essentials, including Oxford shirts, great-fitting denim and chore coats that “men will count on 99 out of 100 days,” says Arts. “What’s really important is to acknowledge that the apparel industry is fundamentally flawed,” she says. “It’s about tackling this cycle of overproduction and overconsumption and really getting people to reconnect with their clothes, to think about what they really need.” (For Arts, these values reflect the Swedish concept of lagom, which translates to “just enough.”) Asket reinforces that commitment through its retail strategy. The brand operates a Stockholm flagship and another store selling samples, returns and second-hand items.\nDaniel Brøndt, co-founder of Another Aspect, a small Swedish menswear brand, champions a similar spirit. “We don’t think people need 10 pairs of jeans,” he says. “We think they need maybe two or three really good pairs that they can keep for a very long time.” Another Aspect releases two collections a year of sustainable hard-working staples with just enough direction to catch the eye of a customer looking for classic pieces with a contemporary twist. The brand’s organic-cotton relaxed button-ups and straight-fit denim are sold at specialty boutiques like Voo Store in Berlin and made an appearance at a pop-up at Colbo in New York last year. It’s the right time for Brøndt’s brand to shine: Scandinavian guys are returning to a classic wardrobe after recovering from logomania, he says. The truth is that there is no singular Scandi-boy style, no unified aesthetic. But the growth of sustainably minded brands and the resale market have blasted the door open to uncharted fashion universes. A little lagom goes a long way. And for what it’s worth, I wore that Our Legacy sweatshirt for years, until it shrank into a crop top.\nThis article first appeared in FASHION’s April 2024 issue.

        "Article": "Here's how to style micro shorts in an elevated way.\n\nBy\nHeather Taylor-Singh\n\nDate April 25, 2024\nLast year, hemlines soared as the micro miniskirt made a resurgence and some people abandoned pants in lieu of tights. Now it seems another super short style has taken the top spot when it comes to stylish transpersonal dressing: Booty shorts (known in the fashion world as micro shorts) are tapping into the Y2K revival that’s been taking over the fashion scene.\nHot off the Spring 2024 runways, the return of the micro short comes as no surprise. Classic black booty shorts appeared at shows from Chanel to Chloé, while Tom Ford and Gucci showcased the trend with fun fabrics like leather and denim. Yet, the style has been in and out of the fashion zeitgeist for decades.\n“Short shorts originated in the 1930s, where women would be seen wearing them as a form of swimwear,” explains stylist Ashley Galang Rico. “By the 1960s, when there was a high demand for denim, people began cropping their jeans, turning them into raw hem cutoffs.”\nDuring the 1970s, the TV hit Dukes of Hazzard shot the short shorts into the spotlight. “Cutoffs began to be more common, with an even shorter style called Daisy Dukes named after Catherine Bach’s character in the television series.” The Daisy Dukes style evolved into hot pants — tight-fitting short shorts made from different fabrics like velour, corduroy and leather.\nNow, they’re back in a new way. Sharing similar ideals of the “no pants trend,” Galang Rico says booty shorts are an easier way to try going pants-free, while still standing out. “The micro short or no pants trend is not only a statement but a trend that challenges notions of modesty in clothing, pushing us to embrace our bodies.”\n“Both women and men can wear the micro short trend without feeling out of place if styled with the right pieces,” notes Galang Rico. The thigh-grazing style has been spotted on celebs like Zendaya, SZA and Kristen Stewart, giving us plenty of outfit inspo for the warmer days ahead.\n \n \nA post shared by Tara Swennen (@taraswennen)\n\nGalang Rico suggests pairing the daring shorts with simple basics like a white shirt or knit sweater. For outerwear, a long overcoat or oversized blazer helps to balance out the revealing nature of the shorts and takes the look from gym class to chic street style. This outfit formula bodes well with sheer black hosiery or over-the-knee socks to balance out the proportions.\n“To complete the look, my footwear of choice would be either a pump or [a pair of] combat boots,” she shares. Dreading showing that much leg? Pair your mini shorts with thigh-high leather boots for a tough but sexy look. Just remember: the shorter, the better.\nThe booty shorts trend isn’t just for one body type. “The fabrics made for micro shorts should have a stretch, to be more form fitting and forgiving, especially for curvier women such as knit and elastane,” says Galang Rico. The shorts silhouette is especially fetching in a dolphin cut, where there’s infinite room for our thighs to breathe.\nBehold: the classic black booty shorts. Perfect for a night on the town, these micro shorts are designed to be fitted throughout with a straight leg.\nMade with 100 per cent TENCEL Lyocell, a lightweight woven suiting fabric, wearing them is a breezy experience.\nIf you’re not feeling black, they’re available in a second equally chic shade of greenish grey.\nShop Now\nOnce a relic of vintage gym class attire, this classic athletic short is making a comeback. Thin (but not see-through) breathable and moisture-wicking, these high-rise micro shorts are the ultimate pick for hot weather.\nMade with 100 per cent stretchy cotton, the cut of the shorts hugs thighs perfectly, effortlessly molding to your body during any activity. Best of all, the style is available in over 20 colours!\nShop Now\nThese pastel short shorts are perfect to wear on a casual day. Boasting a three-inch inseam, the mid-rise shorts are crafted with a breathable poly-spandex blend that’s bound to become a staple in your wardrobe.\nShop Now\nMake your next outfit shine with these eye-catching micro shorts.

They feature a sweat-wicking fabric that’s cool to the touch and fits like a second skin.\nShop Now\nIs rave culture back? These high-waisted shorts indicate yes.

        "Article": "The 'Bridgerton' star is slaying the red carpet, and we should be paying attention. \n\nBy\nKatherine Singh\n\nDate April 24, 2024\nBridgerton fans are only weeks away from getting new episodes of their favourite show, but their season 3 leading lady is already serving the people — at least on the red carpet, that is. We’re calling it: Nicola Coughlan is a fashion icon in the making.\nCoughlan is the star of the third season of the hit Netflix series, Bridgerton, playing one half of the season’s OTP #Polin. While having starred in other popular series like Derry Girls (IYKYK) and the newly-released Big Mood, it’s her role as wallflower Penelope Featherington for the past two seasons that has really catapulted the Irish actress into superstardom.\nAnd while her character on the show may be known for her dowdy yellow outfits and harsh orange hair (we’re sorry, but Penelope needs to get hip to TikTok’s hair theory, stat!), Coughlan — a longtime fashionista — is in full style bloom, walking the Bridgerton and Big Mood red carpets in fits that would make the most fashion minded weep (with joy, and a little bit of envy, of course).\nThis shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to longtime #NicolaStans because even before Bridgerton, the actress has consistently stepped on our necks with her style, popping up at Netflix events in a to-die for Mara Hoffman dress, accessorizing with electric blue Paula Rowan gloves (an Irish designer!), walking the Barbie premiere red carpet in an artfully handmade gown by Wiederhoeft, and attending Vogue World and the Met Gala in some truly out-of-this world dramatic gowns.\n \n \nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n\nThe biggest difference now? Coughlan just has the platform to show off her superb style. And we’re entirely here for it.\nKicking off the Bridgerton press tour on February 15, Coughlan set the scene for her sartorial triumph, as well as looks to come, when she stepped out onto the floral carpet in donning a structured red oversized blazer and matching textured heels from Stella McCartney.\n \n \nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n\nWeeks later, the actress made an appearance at Paris Fashion Week in a snatched Vivienne Westwood dress paired with bedazzled Christian Louboutin platforms.\n \n \nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n\nSoon after, Coughlan was in New York City for the premiere of Big Mood alongside co-star Lydia West in a black Roland Mouret gown, accessorized with a Haute Cuir belt and statement earrings from celeb-beloved designer Misho Designs.\n \n \nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n\nAnd then, the pièce de résistance. On April 12, Coughlan walked the red carpet at a Bridgerton event in what can only be described as a literal masterpiece — a custom gold breastplate from Misho Designs.\n \n \nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n\nWhat makes Coughlan’s fashion moments so A+ is the fact that while these looks may seem quite different, they actually follow a a pretty specific formula. Coughlan and her stylist Aimée Croysdill seemingly know what work for the actress’s tastes and most likely what she feels best in — and it’s working like dynamite.\nThe Derry Girls star and Croysdill  gravitate towards structured pieces with strong tailoring at the shoulders or waistline that emphasize and accentuate the actress’s beautiful shape. Through the gauzy textiles, body-defining silhouettes and deep necklines she dons, Coughlan always manages to look like a perfect mix between a Renaissance painting and a thoroughly modern fashion person. Who knew it was possible to look angelic, sensual and fashion forward all at once?\n \n \nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n\nPlus, the duo aren’t afraid to embrace fashun with a capital freakin’ F, with Coughlan consistently serving a full moment both on and off the carpet. This is a pretty big deal, especially considering how historically inaccessible and discriminatory the fashion industry has been to bodies that don’t fit into a sample size.\nPart of the allure of Coughlan’s looks is the fact that the actress mixes high and low fashion, popping up in high end designers like Vivienne Westwood and then pivoting to an equally stunning, but more accessibly priced ” title=”\n \n \n \nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n” title=”\nA post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan)\n” title=”\n \nRegardless of where the decision comes from, it’s refreshing and necessary to see a plus-size actress so wholly in the limelight unapologetically embrace fashion, and be embraced by the world of high fashion, affirming what we already know: that every body has a place in fashion. (Of course, Coughlan is far from the first public figure with a not-sample-size-body to really lean into high fashion.
